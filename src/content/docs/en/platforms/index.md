OpenClaw core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway — known issues with WhatsApp and
Telegram channels; see [Bun (experimental)](/en/install/bun) for details.

Companion apps exist for Windows Hub, macOS (menu bar app), and mobile nodes
(iOS/Android). Linux companion apps are planned, but the Gateway is fully
supported today. On Windows, choose Windows Hub for the desktop app, native
PowerShell install for terminal-first use, or WSL2 for the most
Linux-compatible Gateway runtime.

- Service status: `openclaw gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `openclaw gateway install`
- Configure flow: `openclaw configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `openclaw doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- macOS: LaunchAgent (`ai.openclaw.gateway` or `ai.openclaw.<profile>`; legacy `com.openclaw.*`)
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
- Native Windows: Scheduled Task (`OpenClaw Gateway` or `OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>)`), with a per-user Startup-folder login item fallback if task creation is denied
